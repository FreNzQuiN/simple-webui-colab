# fastest-stablediffusion-collab-webui
Est. 5-8 minutes to load up everything (including 2nd launch after replacing with new options) 
Still need to time this, will update after    

As far as I can tell, this is faster than any other .ipynb for Google Colab, as it simply installs the webui as if your installing it on your pc with a few Python and Git commands.
Set with anythingV3 model and vae, but can be changed to any by replacing the links.
