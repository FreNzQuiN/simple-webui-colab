# fastest-stablediffusion-collab-webui
As far as I can tell, this is faster than any other .ipynb for Google Colab, as it simply installs the webui as if your installing it on your pc with a few Python and Git commands.

Currently only anythingV3 model and vae.



Changes from Nolan Aatama's original sd-1click-colab (https://github.com/nolanaatama/sd-1click-colab):


Added autocomplete extensions (https://github.com/DominikDoom/a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete) 

Added easy way to mount drive and drop in saved settings



Need to fix/find fix for:
Sampling steps won't change to dropped in options
