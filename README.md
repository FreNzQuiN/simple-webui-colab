# fastest-stablediffusion-collab-webui
As far as I can tell, this is faster than any other .ipynb for Google Colab, as it simply installs the webui as if your installing it on your pc with a few Python commands.

Changes from Nolan Aatama's original sd-1click-colab (https://github.com/nolanaatama/sd-1click-colab):

Added autocomplete extensions
Added easy way to mount drive and drop in saved settings

Need to fix/find fix for:
Sampling steps won't change to dropped in options
